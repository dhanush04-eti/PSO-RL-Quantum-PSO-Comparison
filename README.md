# PSO-RL-Quantum-PSO-Comparison

This repository contains implementations of various Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms, including standard PSO, PSO with Reinforcement Learning, and Quantum-inspired PSO. These algorithms are tested on three benchmark functions: Sphere, Rastrigin, and Ackley.

## Files

1. `pso.py`: Implementation of the standard Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.
2. `pso-rl.py`: PSO algorithm enhanced with Reinforcement Learning techniques.
3. `qspso.py`: Quantum-inspired PSO algorithm using Qiskit for quantum simulations.

## Benchmark Functions

- Sphere Function
- Rastrigin Function
- Ackley Function

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Qiskit (for quantum PSO)

## Usage

Run each Python file separately to see the performance of different PSO variants on the benchmark functions. The scripts will output average, best, and worst performance for each function, along with histograms of the results.

## Notes

This project was created as part of a 2nd year Summer Internship to explore and compare different optimization algorithms. The implementations are basic and meant for educational purposes.

## Future Work

- Implement more PSO variants
- Add more benchmark functions
- Perform statistical analysis of the results
- Optimize the algorithms for better performance
